# ProjectManager

A program to help you manage your project directories.

## Installation & Updating

To install this software, clone the git repo onto your machine. Add the
directory you cloned into to your path, then run `chmod +x pm.py`. You can
now run the project manager using `./pm.py` from any location in your system.

To install the latest updates, run `pm update`. This will check this repo for
updates, and install them using git. To use the updater, you must have git
installed on your system and have used git to install the program initially.
